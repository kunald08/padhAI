# Agile Methodology — From Basics to Expert

---

## 1. Introduction to Agile

### What is Agile?

Agile is a **software development methodology** that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, flexibility, and delivering working software frequently. Instead of building the entire product at once (like Waterfall), Agile breaks work into small, manageable chunks called **iterations** or **sprints**.

### Why Agile Was Born

In the 1990s, software projects had a **70% failure rate** using traditional Waterfall methods. The problems:
- Rigid planning upfront — requirements change was costly
- Customers only saw the product at the end
- Testing happened too late
- Teams worked in silos

Agile was created to solve these exact problems.

### Under the Hood: The Core Philosophy

Agile is not a single process — it's an **umbrella term** for multiple frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.) that share common values. At its core, Agile is about **feedback loops**:

```
Plan → Build → Test → Review → Adapt → Repeat
         ↑________________________________↓
```

Every iteration produces a **potentially shippable product increment**.

## 2. Agile Manifesto

The **Agile Manifesto** was created in 2001 by 17 software practitioners at a ski resort in Utah. It defines **4 values** and **12 principles**.

### The 4 Values

| We Value More                       | Over                          |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Individuals and interactions**    | Processes and tools           |
| **Working software**                | Comprehensive documentation   |
| **Customer collaboration**          | Contract negotiation          |
| **Responding to change**            | Following a plan              |

> **Note**: The items on the right still have value — but we value the items on the left **more**.

### The 12 Principles

1. **Highest priority** is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.
3. **Deliver working software frequently** (weeks rather than months).
4. **Business people and developers** must work together daily.
5. Build projects around **motivated individuals** — give them the environment and trust.
6. **Face-to-face conversation** is the most efficient communication method.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile promotes **sustainable development** — maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design.
10. **Simplicity** — maximizing the amount of work NOT done — is essential.
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
12. Team **reflects and adjusts** its behavior at regular intervals.

### Under the Hood: Why These Principles Matter

Principle #2 ("Welcome changing requirements") is revolutionary. In Waterfall, a change request at month 10 of a 12-month project was a disaster. In Agile, because we work in 2-week sprints, changes only affect the **next sprint**, not the whole project.

## 3. Scrum Framework

Scrum is the **most popular** Agile framework. ~70% of Agile teams use Scrum.

### Scrum Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Product Owner (PO)** | Defines WHAT to build. Owns the Product Backlog. Represents stakeholders. |
| **Scrum Master (SM)** | Ensures the team follows Scrum. Removes blockers. Servant-leader. |
| **Development Team** | Self-organizing cross-functional team (3-9 people). Decides HOW to build. |

### Scrum Artifacts

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Product Backlog** | Ordered list of everything needed in the product. Maintained by PO. |
| **Sprint Backlog** | Subset of Product Backlog selected for the current sprint + a plan to deliver. |
| **Increment** | The sum of all completed backlog items at the end of a sprint — must be "Done". |

### Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

| Event | Duration (2-week sprint) | Purpose |
|-------|--------------------------|---------|
| **Sprint Planning** | 4 hours max | Decide what to do in this sprint |
| **Daily Standup** | 15 minutes max | Sync up — what did I do, what will I do, any blockers? |
| **Sprint Review** | 2 hours max | Demo the increment to stakeholders, get feedback |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | 1.5 hours max | Team reflects on how to improve |

```

### Under the Hood: Why Scrum Works

Scrum creates a **fixed time-box** (sprint). Within that box:
- Scope is fixed (Sprint Backlog items)
- No changes mid-sprint (unless PO cancels the sprint — very rare)
- Team self-organizes to meet the Sprint Goal

This gives teams **predictability** while maintaining **flexibility** at the sprint boundary.

## 4. Sprint Planning

### What Happens in Sprint Planning?

Sprint Planning answers two questions:
1. **WHAT** can be delivered in this Sprint?
2. **HOW** will the chosen work get done?

### The Process

```
Step 1: PO presents the top prioritized items from the Product Backlog
Step 2: Team discusses each item — clarifies requirements
Step 3: Team estimates the effort for each item
Step 4: Team selects items they can finish in the sprint (based on velocity)
Step 5: Team breaks selected items into tasks (Sprint Backlog)
Step 6: Team defines a Sprint Goal
```

### Capacity Planning

```
Team Capacity = Number of Developers × Available Hours × Focus Factor

Example:
- 5 developers
- 6 hours/day productive (out of 8)
- 10 working days in a 2-week sprint
- Focus factor: 0.7 (70% — accounting for meetings, interruptions)

Capacity = 5 × 6 × 10 × 0.7 = 210 hours
```

### Definition of Done (DoD)

The team must define what "Done" means. Example:

```
✅ Code complete
✅ Unit tests written and passing
✅ Code reviewed by at least 1 peer
✅ No critical/high bugs
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Deployed to staging environment
✅ PO has accepted the story
```

## 5. Agile User Stories

### What is a User Story?

A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature **told from the user's perspective**.

### Format

```
As a [type of user],
I want [an action/feature],
So that [a benefit/value].
```

### Examples

```
As a customer,
I want to search products by category,
So that I can quickly find what I need.

As an admin,
I want to export reports as PDF,
So that I can share them with stakeholders.
```

### INVEST Criteria for Good User Stories

| Letter | Meaning | Explanation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **I** | Independent | Story can be developed independently of others |
| **N** | Negotiable | Details can be discussed and refined |
| **V** | Valuable | Must deliver value to the user/customer |
| **E** | Estimable | Team must be able to estimate the effort |
| **S** | Small | Small enough to complete in one sprint |
| **T** | Testable | Must have clear acceptance criteria |

### Acceptance Criteria (AC)

Every user story needs acceptance criteria — these define when the story is "done":

```
Story: As a user, I want to log in with email and password.

Acceptance Criteria:
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter a valid email and password
  Then I should be redirected to the dashboard

  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter an invalid email or password
  Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"

  Given I am on the login page
  When I leave email or password empty
  Then the login button should be disabled
```

### Under the Hood: Epics → Stories → Tasks

```
Epic (large feature)
  └── User Story 1
  │     ├── Task 1.1
  │     ├── Task 1.2
  │     └── Task 1.3
  └── User Story 2
  │     ├── Task 2.1
  │     └── Task 2.2
  └── User Story 3
        ├── Task 3.1
        └── Task 3.2
```

- **Epic**: Large body of work (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- **Story**: A slice of the epic (e.g., "Login with email/password")
- **Task**: Technical work to complete the story (e.g., "Create login API endpoint")

---

## 6. Story Pointing

### What is Story Pointing?

Story pointing is a **relative estimation** technique. Instead of estimating in hours, teams assign **story points** — a unit of effort, complexity, and uncertainty.

### Fibonacci Scale

Teams commonly use the **Fibonacci sequence**: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`

| Points | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial — change a label, fix a typo |
| 2 | Simple — well-understood, minimal effort |
| 3 | Small — clear requirements, moderate effort |
| 5 | Medium — some complexity, might need research |
| 8 | Large — significant complexity, multiple components |
| 13 | Very Large — high uncertainty, consider splitting |
| 21 | Too Large — MUST be split into smaller stories |

### Planning Poker

The most popular estimation technique:

```
1. PO reads a user story
2. Team discusses and asks clarifying questions
3. Each member privately selects a card (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
4. All cards are revealed simultaneously
5. If consensus → that's the estimate
6. If disagreement → highest and lowest explain their reasoning
7. Re-vote until consensus
```

### Under the Hood: Why Relative Estimation Works

Humans are bad at absolute estimation ("This will take 4.5 hours") but good at **relative** estimation ("This is twice as complex as that other story").

Story points abstract away:
- Individual skill differences
- Interruptions
- Unknown unknowns

Over time, the team's **velocity** (average story points completed per sprint) becomes the predictor.

---

## 7. Agile Estimation and Planning

### Velocity

**Velocity** = Total story points completed in a sprint.

```
Sprint 1: 24 points completed
Sprint 2: 28 points completed
Sprint 3: 22 points completed
Sprint 4: 26 points completed

Average Velocity = (24 + 28 + 22 + 26) / 4 = 25 points/sprint
```

### Release Planning

```
Total remaining story points: 200
Average velocity: 25 points/sprint
Sprint duration: 2 weeks

Estimated sprints to complete = 200 / 25 = 8 sprints
Estimated release date = 8 × 2 = 16 weeks from now
```

### Burndown Chart

A burndown chart tracks remaining work over time:

```
Story Points
    │
 100├─●
    │   ●
  80├─────●
    │       ●
  60├─────────●
    │           ●
  40├─────────────●          ← Ideal burndown (straight line)
    │               ●
  20├─────────────────●
    │                   ●
   0├─────────────────────●
    └──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──→ Days
       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
```

### Burnup Chart

Shows work completed vs total scope:

```
Story Points
    │                        ── Total Scope

    └──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──→ Days
```

## 8. Agile Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Velocity** | Team throughput per sprint | Sum of completed story points |
| **Sprint Burndown** | Remaining work in current sprint | Remaining points vs. time |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from start to finish of an item | End date - Start date |
| **Lead Time** | Time from request to delivery | Delivery date - Request date |
| **Throughput** | Number of items completed per time period | Items completed / Time period |
| **Escaped Defects** | Bugs found in production | Count of production bugs per sprint |

### Velocity Chart

```

## 9. SDLC vs Agile

### Traditional SDLC (Waterfall)

```
Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
     ↓            ↓          ↓            ↓          ↓
  (Months)    (Months)   (Months)     (Months)   (Once)
```

### Agile SDLC

```
Sprint 1: [Plan → Design → Code → Test → Deploy] → Increment 1
Sprint 2: [Plan → Design → Code → Test → Deploy] → Increment 2
Sprint 3: [Plan → Design → Code → Test → Deploy] → Increment 3
...
```

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Approach** | Sequential, linear | Iterative, incremental |
| **Requirements** | Fixed upfront | Evolving, flexible |
| **Delivery** | One big release at the end | Frequent small releases |
| **Testing** | After development phase | Continuous (every sprint) |
| **Customer Involvement** | Beginning and end | Throughout the project |
| **Change** | Expensive and difficult | Welcome and expected |
| **Risk** | High — discovered late | Low — discovered early |
| **Documentation** | Extensive, detailed | Lightweight, just enough |
| **Team Structure** | Specialized silos | Cross-functional |
| **Feedback** | Late | Continuous |
| **Best For** | Stable, well-defined requirements | Evolving, complex projects |

### Under the Hood: The Cost of Change

```
Cost of Change in Waterfall:
                                          ████
                                      ████
                                  ████
                              ████

Sprint1  S2    S3    S4    S5    S6
               (Cost stays relatively flat)
```

## 10. Software Support and Maintenance

### Types of Maintenance

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Corrective** | Fixing bugs | Fixing a broken login flow |
| **Adaptive** | Adapting to environment changes | Upgrading to new OS version |
| **Perfective** | Improving performance/features | Optimizing database queries |
| **Preventive** | Preventing future problems | Refactoring technical debt |

### Maintenance in Agile

In Agile, maintenance is **not a separate phase** — it's part of every sprint:

```
Sprint Backlog:
  ├── New Feature Stories (60-70%)
  ├── Bug Fixes (15-20%)
  ├── Technical Debt (10-15%)
  └── Maintenance Tasks (5-10%)
```

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

```
Priority 1 (Critical): Response within 15 minutes, resolution within 4 hours
Priority 2 (High):     Response within 1 hour, resolution within 8 hours
Priority 3 (Medium):   Response within 4 hours, resolution within 24 hours
Priority 4 (Low):      Response within 8 hours, resolution within 72 hours
```
